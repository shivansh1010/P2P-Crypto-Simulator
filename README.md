# P2P-Crypto-Simulator

### Description
This is a simple peer-to-peer crypto currency simulator. It is a simple console application that simulates the transfer of crypto currency between peers. It is written in Python.

### Install dependencies
Note: Ensure `python3` and `pip3` are installed on your system.

```bash
sudo apt install graphviz -y
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure Simulation Parameters

Simulation parameters can be configured in ==config.ini== file:
- **execution_time:** Time for which simulation should run
- **total_nodes:** Total number of nodes in the network
- **percent_slow_nodes:** - The percentage of nodes that are slow 
- **percent_low_cpu_nodes:** - The percentage of nodes that have low cpu and less hashing power
- **min_neighbors:** Minimum number of neighbors that each node should have
- **max_neighbors:** Maximum number of neighbors that each node should have
- **mean_interarrival_time_sec (T~tx~):** The mean interarrival time between transactions generated by any peer
- **slow_node_link_speed:** Network bandwidth of a slow link in **Mbps**
- **fast_node_link_speed:** Network bandwidth of a fast link in **Mbps**
- **mean_mining_time_sec (I):** Mean interarrival time between blocks


### Run the application
```bash
python3 main.py config.ini
```
Note: For development, we recommend using VSCode with the Python, and Python Debugger extensions.
